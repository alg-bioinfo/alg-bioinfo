### Hi there 👋🏾!

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a project at UF Health to develop a cancer genomics database to facilitate the translational use of artificial intelligence in clinical research. I am an aspiring data engineer developing my skills in Microsoft Azure, Hadoop, and AWS. In the future I hope to empower everyone in their work by creating optimal data workflows and pipelines.
